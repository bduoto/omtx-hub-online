2. **Performed API Consolidation**: Reduced 101 endpoints to 11 unified endpoints (89% reduction)
3. **Architecture Pivot**: User clarified "we dont use modal anymore we are using cloud run"
4. **Implemented GKE + Cloud Run Jobs**: Built comprehensive hybrid architecture
5. **Deployment Issues**: Encountered GPU worker container startup problems

#### **Conversation Evolution**
- **Initial**: Fix 404 errors and consolidate APIs
- **Middle**: "can we consolidate our api endpoints? there are several we aren't using"
- **Pivot**: "we dont use modal anymore we are using cloud run"
- **Final Request**: "I think we will have over 1000 users so this works well for me. let's do the GKE + Cloud Run Jobs"

#### **What We Built**
1. **Job Submission Service** (`backend/services/job_submission_service.py`):
   - Handles individual and batch job submissions
